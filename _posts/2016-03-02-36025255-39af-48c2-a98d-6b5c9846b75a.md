# Welcome!

And thank you for checking out my site! I'm a Dutch (ambitious/Up and coming/upbeat) audio engineer, producer, musician and composer living in London. For the past two years I've been running my own little studio in Palm Recordings, North London where I have a room and vocal/instrument booth and have since been involved in some great projects. Most notable is a 28 track production with Guy Massey and Ion Metsovitis for Paul McCartney's release of the Wings Over America tour. Previous projects include music for advertising campaigns for Vodafone and Nokia in collaboration with Salt. Other fun projects have been mixing for the boy band Blue's Funky Viva Remix Single for their 2011 Euro Vision Song Festival EP "I Can", Gitta De Ridder, mastering "New Desert Blues", "Ali Warren" and producing bands/artists like "Rueben Hollebon", "The Paul Child Band", "Shanty", "No Small Peril", "Blame Fable", "Jazz Mino" and many others.

Currently I'm a member of the Music Producers Guild and have been accredited as a Protools HD Operator and since 2013 a Protools HD Music Expert. I started out in music, while studying Industrial Design (Bsc)in Delft, where I enjoyed playing keys for several student bands like, Catweasel, The Hermes House band and Sigs! as well as being involved in performances for dutch and international artists like Antonie Kamerling and Gloria Gaynor. While in the Netherlands I collaborated with Wiboud Burkens, Ewout Ongering, Arjen Rooijackers, Christiaan Maats, Jurgen Perier, Jamie Westland, Pablo Penton, Henk Temming. After following a producers course at the IAB in Utrecht I developed a taste for a deeper understanding of the audio world and decided to move to London where I enrolled in the MA Audio Production at the University of Westminster in 2004 to give my career a fighting chance. It resulted in many life changing experiences and great collaborations such as featuring Tara Macdonald's vocal performance for the final project. After finishing the course I was offered a position as technician (2007-2011) for the Bmus in Music Performances. The job was a great opportunity and platform to meet many talented musicians and learn more about audio engineering and music production. I was also involved as a visiting lecturer.

I really love to create music with and for people and aim to incorporate more aspects than audio production alone. Having finished in 2008 the part-time MA Design Studies at Central Saint Martins (University of the Arts) I combined my interests in music, arts, robotics and design to find exciting perspectives for producing new music and sounds (www.thesilentbubble.com).

I'm very much looking forward to working with new people and I hope I can be of service to contribute in a positive way to your journey,

Best wishes,
